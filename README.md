# Game AI Project
As part of this project, we designed and developed a game that incorporates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** techniques to enhance gameplay and player experience. This is outlined in detail below.

## Game Theme & Concept Summary

The game was developed for this year's Game Jam under the theme **"Beating the Pandemic"**. Rather than focusing on the current global pandemic, the team drew inspiration from a historical pandemic â€” **The Black Death** in the Middle Ages.

The main character is a **Plague Doctor**, a historical figure believed to have treated victims of the plague. In the game, the Plague Doctor embarks on a mission to defeat enemies, uncover the source of the pestilence, and ultimately obtain the cure from the final boss.

To align with the theme:
- **Rats and bats** (known historical carriers of the plague) serve as common enemies.
- Enemies may drop **potions** (which restore health) or **viruses** (which harm the player).
- The **visual design** features a **medieval user interface** and **dark, horror-inspired dungeon environments** to reflect the grim atmosphere of the era.

The game blends historical context with action gameplay to creatively interpret the theme.

## Gameplay Overview

The game begins with a **start scene** where the player chooses a character nickname. After submission, a **cutscene** introduces the story. Once complete, the player is taken to the **main menu**, where they can:

- Start the game
- Adjust settings (sound, fullscreen, controls)
- Quit the game

### Level Progression

- The first level introduces **basic game controls**.
- In each level, the player must **defeat all enemies** to unlock the door to the next level.
- **Difficulty increases** with each level.
- **Sound effects** (e.g. rats squeaking, doors unlocking) enhance immersion.

### Secret Room (Level 2)

- A hidden **secret room** contains a swarm of bacteria.
- The player is given a **fumigator weapon** to defeat them.
- There's a **high chance** of obtaining a powerful weapon that can be used for the rest of the game.

### Loot System

- Defeated enemies may drop:
  - **Potions**: restore health
  - **Viruses**: cause damage
- The loot system is **probability-based**, with better drops (e.g. weapons, potions) appearing more frequently in higher levels.

### Final Level & Boss Fight

- Once all enemies are defeated in the final level, the **boss enemy** spawns.
- The boss is the toughest opponent in the game.
- Upon defeat, the boss drops a **mysterious book**, marking the game's conclusion and the discovery of the cure.
